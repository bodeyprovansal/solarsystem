CST325 - Fall '19

1) Vectors and Matrices

The assigments pre-WebGL were the most enjoyable. While WebGL 
is much more powerful than hand-coding graphics, I was able to better grasp what we 
were accomplishing week-by-week in the first few weeks. 

Getting to learn the math concepts and then visualize how we apply them was helpful in 
understanding what we were doing. 

2) A little more explanation on how we are supposed to use our partners for support in 
this class. We were supposed to have worked on the code together, but we each needed our 
own submission. It seemed like we were supposed to use pair-programming, but also have
written the program ourselves. 

By the end of the class, my partner and I just stopped trying to help each other because we
were unsure what was and was not against the rules of the class.
